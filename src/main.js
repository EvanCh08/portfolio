              NUANSA is an esteemed Indonesian drama musical theater production
              at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Before the COVID19
              Pandemic, NUANSA had always been operating in the University
              Cultural Centre (NUS). I took charge of decision-making processes
              for meetings, leading these crucial gatherings, and actively
              organizing the committee. My skills are tested by being
              responsible for determining the property sets and prices.
              Including where to buy them and what are their dimensions. This
              required me to run through the script and took note of the
              properties that are needed in a particular scenario. In addition
              to that, I also made friends and built networks with fellow
              friends. I am very excited to work with them and build a strong
              relationship. I believe that the event will run smoothly.{" "}

              Data Analyst Internship at PT Catur Kimiatama Agung

            <p className="text-white text-lg font-ubuntu text-justify text-opacity-80">
              During summer, I did my very first internship in Indonesia which
              is in PT Catur Kimiatama Agung. It is a company that operates with
              paint and powders I had an incredible experience of talking to my
              supervisor of my internship. I first made the report on my own, by
              seeing the sales company data from an excel sheet. I observed many
              things and learned that factors on how a company operates can
              vary. After that, I collaborated with my supervisor and seek for
              his advices on my insights. I improved the report that I have made
              earlier and submitted it to the supervisor, to be presented to the
              upper managers. However, I got a one of a lifetime chance to
              present myself and my findings in front of my manager at the last
              weeks of my internship. I had my utmost experience here, due to
              the work environment.{" "}
