              In terms of technical skills, I have experiences in both react native for app development and react js for web development. 
              I performed well with React Native, React JS, Supabase, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. In addition to that, I have also learned about SQL, Tableau, and python for data analytics.  {" "}

              I value the principles of setting the right purpose and believe. I have always set the purpose of things that I am doing in my life. Setting the purpose will give us the idea to take actions. Next up, Believe. Believing is one word that has a powerful meaning. When I believe that I can achieve, I will be able to achieve with the help of God and the people surrounding me. {" "}

If I were to define one of my weaknesses, I would say that I can have a sudden anxiety, to speak in front of many people. I have always been trying to transform it into my strength instead, by taking a public speaking course in my university.{" "}

              NUANSA is an esteemed Indonesian drama musical theater production
              at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Before the COVID19
              Pandemic, NUANSA had always been operating in the University
              Cultural Centre (NUS). I took charge of decision-making processes
              for meetings, leading these crucial gatherings, and actively
              organizing the committee. My skills are tested by being
              responsible for determining the property sets and prices.
              Including where to buy them and what are their dimensions. This
              required me to run through the script and took note of the
              properties that are needed in a particular scenario. In addition
              to that, I also made friends and built networks with fellow
              friends. I am very excited to work with them and build a strong
              relationship. I believe that the event will run smoothly.{" "}

              paint and powders I had an incredible experience of talking to my
              supervisor of my internship. I first made the report on my own, by
              seeing the sales company data from an excel sheet. I observed many
              things and learned that factors on how a company operates can
              vary. After that, I collaborated with my supervisor and seek for
              His advice on my insights. I improved the report that I have made
              earlier and submitted it to the supervisor, to be presented to the
              upper managers. However, I got a one of a lifetime chance to
              present myself and my findings in front of my manager at the last
              weeks of my internship. I had my utmost experience here, due to
